2014-05-12 version 0.4.4:

* Send session variable 'timezone' to Presto using X-Presto-Time-Zone HTTP

  always acquire a connection to cancel a running query.


2014-03-19 version 0.4.2:

* Send queries to PostgreSQL if they most likely cause parse erorr because
  Presto doesn't return appropriate error code (42601 SYNTAX ERROR).

  themn to a temporary table to not cause "value too long for type character
  varying(255)" exceptions
